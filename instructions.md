# [Proceedings](https://indico.jlab.org/event/459/page/356-proceedings)

CHEP 2023 will be publishing a peer-reviewed proceedings through the [EPJ Web of Conferences](https://www.epj-conferences.org/).

The deadline for the initial submission of your articles is: **Sat Sep 23 2023 at 09:00 UTC**.

## Note

Frontiers for Big Data approached us to develop a dedicated "CHEP 2023" research topic in their journal.
The plan is for the CHEP Program Committee and CHEP23 Proceedings editors to select 5--10 high-quality Proceedings papers to 'promote' and recommend for a long-paper version to be published in Frontiers' section on "[Big Data and AI in High Energy Physics](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/big-data/sections/big-data-and-ai-in-high-energy-physics)".

There is nothing extra that the CHEP23 Proceedings authors need to do to be considered for a long-paper recommendation (beyond writing a great Proceedings short-paper).
