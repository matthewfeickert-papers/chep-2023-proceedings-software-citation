\section{Current State of Software Citation in HEP}\label{sec:current_state}

\subsection{LHC Experiments}\label{sec:lhc_experiments}

To understand the current state of software citation in the field reports from the ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb experiments were given that summarized the experiments current standards and practices and future plans.
ATLAS takes the approach of using a ``catch-all'' citation of all ATLAS software and firmware through the citation of an ATLAS public note that ``briefly describes the software and provides links to dynamic and persistent repositories wherein the code resides''.~\cite{ATL-SOFT-PUB-2021-001}
This public note is then cited in many ATLAS papers.
ATLAS does additionally cite the paper on the ATLAS detector simulation software as well as GEANT4, and the Monte Carlo simulation generators.
In terms of statistical analysis ATLAS cites the methodology papers that describe the techniques being implemented in software, but in general does not cite the actual software that implements the techniques and is used for physics analysis.
This is not uniformly consistent in the experiment though, with some physics groups beginning to regularly cite statistical libraries with clear citation requests~\cite{pyhf,pyhf_joss}.
