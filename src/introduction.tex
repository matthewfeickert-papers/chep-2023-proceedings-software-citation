\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Software citation is important.
In November 2022, the HEP Software Foundation (HSF) and the Institute for Research and Innovation for Software in High-Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP)~\cite{S2I2HEPSP,IRISHEPWEB} organized a topical workshop on software citation and recognition in the field of high energy physics (HEP)~\cite{software_citation_workshop_report,software_citation_indico}.
The goal of the workshop was to provide a community discussion around ways in which HEP experiments handle citation of software and recognition for software efforts that enable physics results disseminated to the public.
