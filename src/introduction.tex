\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
In November 2022, the HEP Software Foundation (HSF) and the Institute for Research and Innovation for Software in High-Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP)~\cite{S2I2HEPSP,IRISHEPWEB} organized a topical workshop on software citation and recognition in the field of high energy physics (HEP)~\cite{software_citation_workshop_report,software_citation_indico}.
The goal of the workshop was to provide a community discussion around ways in which HEP experiments handle citation of software and recognition for software efforts that enable physics results disseminated to the public.
The workshop participants and primary presentations were from the LHC experiments that are primary stakeholders in IRIS-HEP operations: ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb; the particle physics software development communities: ROOT Team, Scikit-HEP~\cite{Rodrigues:2020syo}, MCnet, and IRIS-HEP; as well as the scientific publishing community and ecosystem most involved with HEP: Elsevier, the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)~\cite{smith_journal_2018}, and INSPIRE~\cite{INSPIRE}.
