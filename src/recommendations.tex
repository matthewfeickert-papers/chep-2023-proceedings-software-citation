\section{Recommendations}\label{sec:recommendations}

Hi.
% INSPIRE
% Currently handles software papers, but has plans to add support for Data and Software
% Citations would be tracked and counted by DOI
% Elsevier
% Community needs to reach consensus on how to cite software, and share outcome with publishers (won't take lead)
% Publishers can better instruct editors and referees what publishers expect from them
% Journal of Open Source Software
% In addition to incentivizing high quality software, JOSS can help bridge the gap
% "recognize that for most researchers, papers and not software are the currency of academic research"
