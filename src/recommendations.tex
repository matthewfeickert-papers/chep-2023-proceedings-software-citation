\textbf{TODO: REVISE AND FINISH}\\
Use of Zenodo as a long term archive of source code provides automated DOI generation for each release of the software.
Adopting the CITATION File Format as a common standard and adding \texttt{CITATION.cff} files to all software project version control repositories provides multiple technical boons.
As \texttt{CITATION.cff} files are written in YAML they offer a both human- and machine-readable file format with a well defined, versioned schema, which is programmatically convertible to other citation formats (i.e., BibTeX, CodeMeta, EndNote, RIS, schema.org, Zenodo, APA) through tooling.
\texttt{CITATION.cff} has also been adopted by Zenodo, GitHub, and GitLab, providing accessibility and portability.
