\subsection{Technical Recommendations}\label{sec:recommendations_technical}

In addition to establishing guidelines for the HEP community, recommendations of software citation best practices and supported tooling aids in community adoption of guidelines.

\textbf{TODO: REVISE AND FINISH}\\
Use of Zenodo as a long term archive of source code provides automated DOI generation for each release of the software.
Adopting the CITATION File Format as a common standard and adding \texttt{CITATION.cff} files to all software project version control repositories provides multiple technical boons.
As \texttt{CITATION.cff} files are written in YAML they offer a both human- and machine-readable file format with a well defined, versioned schema, which is programmatically convertible to other citation formats (i.e., BibTeX, CodeMeta, EndNote, RIS, schema.org, Zenodo, APA) through tooling.
\texttt{CITATION.cff} has also been adopted by Zenodo, GitHub, and GitLab, providing accessibility and portability.

\textbf{REVISE AND FINISH}

There has been historical precedent in HEP for tools to provide guidelines for how to cite the software being used by printing it as a runtime banner to standard output.
This method was developed before citation conventions were established more broadly in the scientific computing community, and modern practices would generally avoid interrupting user logs with this information.
It is instead preferable to in addition to having a clearly advertized recommended citation in the software documentation to additionally provide citation APIs in the software --- both at the language level and at the command line interface if the software supports one.
